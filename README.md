# odin-hashmap

This project implements basic HashMap and HashSet classes using custom Node and LinkedList classes.
These data structures provide efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of key-value pairs (for the HashMap) and unique keys (for the HashSet).
Both data structures support automatic resizing when the load factor exceeds a defined threshold.

Please note that all keys and values are coerced into strings for consistency.
